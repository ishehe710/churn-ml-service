# Customer Churn Predictor Using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement 

Costumer churn is when customers stop buying products or services from a compay. It is very important metric for businesses since it affects revenue and the performance of them. Thus, being able to mitigate customer churn is very important, especially with the growing rise of subscription-based services. 

For this project I will make an application that predicts churn, using machine learning. This is a binary classification task as the target feature is whether or not a customer has churned or not when it comes to the model. The application will predict churn, in addition to provide visulizations of it. This technology like this is of help to businesses, since it predict churn. By using this technology, companies can take proactive measures to reduce churn and monitor business performance effectively.
